    "innerHtml": "JEAN BAPTISTE RACINE, the younger contemporary of Corneille, and his rival for supremacy in French classical tragedy, was born at Ferte-Milon, December 21, 1639. He was educated at the College of Beauvais, at the great Jansenist school at Port Royal, and at the College d'Harcourt. He attracted notice by an ode written for the marriage of Louis XIV in 1660, and made his first really great dramatic success with his \"Andromaque.\" His tragic masterpieces include \"Britannicus,\" \"Berenice,\" \"Bajazet,\" \"Mithridate,\" \"Iphigenie,\" and \"Phaedre,\" all written between 1669 and 1677. Then for some years he gave up dramatic composition, disgusted by the intrigues of enemies who sought to injure his career by exalting above him an unworthy rival. In 1689 he resumed his work under the persuasion of Mme. de Maintenon, and produced \"Esther\" and \"Athalie,\" the latter ranking among his finest productions, although it did not receive public recognition until some time after his death in 1699. Besides his tragedies, Racine wrote one comedy, \"Les Plaideurs,\" four hymns of great beauty, and a history of Port Royal."

    "innerHtml": "The external conventions of classical tragedy which had been established by Corneille, Racine did not attempt to modify. His study of the Greek tragedians and his own taste led him to submit willingly to the rigor and simplicity of form which were the fundamental marks of the classical ideal. It was in his treatment of character that he differed most from his predecessor; for whereas, as we have seen, Corneille represented his leading figures as heroically subduing passion by force of will, Racine represents his as driven by almost uncontrollable passion. Thus his creations appeal to the modern reader as more warmly human; their speech, if less exalted, is simpler and more natural; and he succeeds more brilliantly with his portraits of women than with those of men."
  },
  {
    "tag": "p",
    "innerHtml": "All these characteristics are exemplified in \"Phaedre,\" the tragedy of Racine which has made an appeal to the widest audience. To the legend as treated by Euripides, Racine added the love of Hippolytus for Aricia, and thus supplied a motive for Phaedra's jealousy, and at the same time he made the nurse instead of Phaedra the calumniator of his son to Theseus."

Scarcely had I\nBeen bound to Theseus by the marriage yoke,\nAnd happiness and peace seem'd well secured,\nWhen Athens show'd me my proud enemy.\nI look'd, alternately turn'd pale and blush'd\nTo see him, and my soul grew all distraught;\nA mist obscured my vision, and my voice\nFalter'd, my blood ran cold, then burn'd like fire;\nVenus I felt in all my fever'd frame,\nWhose fury had so many of my race\nPursued. With fervent vows I sought to shun\nHer torments, built and deck'd for her a shrine,\nAnd there, 'mid countless victims did I seek\nThe reason I had lost; but all for naught,\nNo remedy could cure the wounds of love!\nIn vain I offer'd incense on her altars;\nWhen I invoked her name my heart adored\nHippolytus, before me constantly;\nAnd when I made her altars smoke with victims,\n'Twas for a god whose name I dared not utter.\nI fled his presence everywhere, but found him—\nO crowning horror!—in his father's features.\nAgainst myself, at last, I raised revolt,\nAnd stirr'd my courage up to persecute\nThe enemy I loved. To banish him\nI wore a step—dame's harsh and jealous carriage,\nWith ceaseless cries I clamour'd for his exile,\nTill I had torn him from his father's arms.\nI breathed once more, Oenone; in his absence\nMy days flow'd on less troubled than before,\nAnd innocent. Submissive to my husband,\nI hid my grief, and of our fatal marriage\nCherish'd the fruits. Vain caution! Cruel Fate!\nBrought hither by my spouse himself, I saw\nAgain the enemy whom I had banish'd,\nAnd the old wound too quickly bled afresh.\nNo longer is it love hid in my heart,\nBut Venus in her might seizing her prey.\nI have conceived just terror for my crime;\nI hate my life, and hold my love in horror.\nDying I wish'd to keep my fame unsullied,\nAnd bury in the grave a guilty passion;\nBut I have been unable to withstand\nTears and entreaties, I have told you all;\nContent, if only, as my end draws near,\nYou do not vex me with unjust reproaches,\nNor with vain efforts seek to snatch from death\nThe last faint lingering sparks of vital breath."

His noble chargers, erst\nSo full of ardour to obey his voice,\nWith head depress'd and melancholy eye\nSeem'd now to mark his sadness and to share it.\nA frightful cry, that issues from the deep,\nWith sudden discord rends the troubled air;\nAnd from the bosom of the earth a groan\nIs heard in answer to that voice of terror.\nOur blood is frozen at our very hearts;\nWith bristling manes the list'ning steeds stand still.\nMeanwhile upon the watery plain there rises\nA mountain billow with a mighty crest\nOf foam, that shoreward rolls, and, as it breaks\nBefore our eyes vomits a furious monster.\nWith formidable horns its brow is arm'd,\nAnd all its body clothed with yellow scales,\nIn front a savage bull, behind a dragon\nTurning and twisting in impatient rage.\nIts long continued bellowings make the shore\nTremble; the sky seems horror-struck to see it;\nThe earth with terror quakes; its poisonous breath\nInfects the air. The wave that brought it ebbs\nIn fear. All fly, forgetful of the courage\nThat cannot aid, and in a neighbouring temple\nTake refuge—all save bold Hippolytus.\nA hero's worthy son, he stays his steeds,\nSeizes his darts, and, rushing forward, hurls\nA missile with sure aim that wounds the monster\nDeep in the flank. With rage and pain it springs\nE'en to the horses' feet, and, roaring, falls,\nWrithes in the dust, and shows a fiery throat\nThat covers them with flames, and blood, and smoke.\nFear lends them wings; deaf to his voice for once,\nAnd heedless of the curb, they onward fly.\nTheir master wastes his strength in efforts vain;\nWith foam and blood each courser's bit is red.\nSome say a god, amid this wild disorder,\nWas seen with goads pricking their dusty flanks.\nO'er jagged rocks they rush urged on by terror;\nCrash! goes the axle-tree. Th' intrepid youth\nSees his car broken up, flying to pieces;\nHe falls himself entangled in the reins.\nPardon my grief. That cruel spectacle\nWill be for me a source of endless tears.\nI saw thy hapless son, I saw him, Sire,\nDrag'd by the horses that his hands had fed,\nPow'rless to check their fierce career, his voice\nBut adding to their fright, his body soon\nOne mass of wounds. Our cries of anguish fill\nThe plain. At last they slacken their swift pace,\nThen stop, not far from those old tombs that mark\nWhere lie the ashes of his royal sires.\nPanting I thither run, and after me\nHis guard, along the track stain'd with fresh blood\nThat reddens all the rocks; caught in the briers\nLocks of his hair hang dripping, gory spoils!\nI come, I call him. Stretching forth his hand,\nHe opens his dying eyes, soon closed again.\n\"The gods have robb'd me of a guiltless life,\"\nI hear him say: \"Take care of sad Aricia\nWhen I am dead. Dear friend, if e'er my father\nMourn, undeceived, his son's unhappy fate\nFalsely accused; to give my spirit peace,\nTell him to treat his captive tenderly,\nAnd to restore—\" With that the hero's breath\nFails, and a mangled corpse lies in my arms,\nA piteous object, trophy of the wrath\nOf Heav'n—so changed, his father would not know him."
