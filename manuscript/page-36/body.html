<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>PHAEDRA</p><p>Ye gods!</p><p>PANOPE</p><p>Divided counsels sway
The choice of Athens; some would have the prince,
Your child, for master; others, disregarding
The laws, dare to support the stranger's son.
'Tis even said that a presumptuous faction
Would crown Aricia and the house of Pallas.
I deem'd it right to warn you of this danger.
Hippolytus already is prepared
To start, and should he show himself at Athens,
'Tis to be fear'd the fickle crowd will all
Follow his lead.</p><p>OENONE</p><p>Enough. The queen, who hears you,
By no means will neglect this timely warning.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
