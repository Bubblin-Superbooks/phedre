<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">guilty passion;
But I have been unable to withstand
Tears and entreaties, I have told you all;
Content, if only, as my end draws near,
You do not vex me with unjust reproaches,
Nor with vain efforts seek to snatch from death
The last faint lingering sparks of vital breath.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
