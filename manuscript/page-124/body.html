<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">from this shore and far from you I'll fly,
For here the image of my mangled son
Would haunt my memory and drive me mad.
From the whole world I fain would banish me,
For all the world seems to rise up in judgment
Against me; and my very glory weights
My punishment; for, were my name less known
'Twere easier to hide me. All the favours
The gods have granted me I mourn and hate,
Nor will I importune them with vain pray'rs
Henceforth for ever. Give me what they may,
What they have taken will all else outweigh.</p><p>PHAEDRA</p><p>Theseus, I cannot hear you and keep silence:
I must repair the wrong that he has suffer'd—
Your son was innocent.</p><p>THESEUS</p><p>Unhappy father!
And it was on your word that I condemn'd him!
Think you such cruelty can be excused—</p></div> </div>
