<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">peaceful haunts, so dear to happy childhood,
Where I have seen you oft prefer to stay,
Rather than meet the tumult and the pomp
Of Athens and the court? What danger shun you,
Or shall I say what grief?</p><p>HIPPOLYTUS</p><p>That happy time
Is gone, and all is changed, since to these shores
The gods sent Phaedra.</p><p>THERAMENES</p><p>I perceive the cause
Of your distress. It is the queen whose sight
Offends you. With a step-dame's spite she schemed
Your exile soon as she set eyes on you.
But if her hatred is not wholly vanish'd,
It has at least taken a milder aspect.
Besides, what danger can a dying woman,
One too who longs for death, bring on your head?
Can Phaedra, sick'ning of a dire disease
Of which she will not speak, weary of life
And of herself, form any plots against you?</p><p>HIPPOLYTUS</p></div> </div>
