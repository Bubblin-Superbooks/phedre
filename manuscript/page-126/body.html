Death, from mine eyes veiling the light of heav'n,
Restores its purity that they defiled.</p><p>PANOPE</p><p>She dies my lord!</p><p>THESEUS</p><p>Would that the memory
Of her disgraceful deed could perish with her!
Ah, disabused too late! Come, let us go,
And with the blood of mine unhappy son
Mingle our tears, clasping his dear remains,
In deep repentance for a pray'r detested.
Let him be honour'd as he well deserves;
And, to appease his sore offended ghost,
Be her near kinsmen's guilt whate'er it may,
Aricia shall be held my daughter from to-day.</p></div> </div>
