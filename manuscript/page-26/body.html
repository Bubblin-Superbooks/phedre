The dawn has chased the darkness thence, since food
Pass'd your wan lips, and you are faint and languid.
To what dread purpose is your heart inclined?
How dare you make attempts upon your life,
And so offend the gods who gave it you,
Prove false to Theseus and your marriage vows,
Ay, and betray your most unhappy children,
Bending their necks yourself beneath the yoke?
That day, be sure, which robs them of their mother,
Will give high hopes back to the stranger's son,
To that proud enemy of you and yours,
To whom an Amazon gave birth, I mean
Hippolytusâ€”</p><p>PHAEDRA</p><p>Ye gods!</p><p>OENONE</p><p>Ah, this reproach
Moves you!</p><p>PHAEDRA</p><p>Unhappy woman, to what name
Gave your mouth utterance?</p></div> </div>
