<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">conspires to add
To my distress!</p><p>OENONE</p><p>What is one moment wish'd,
The next, is irksome. Did you not just now,
Sick of inaction, bid us deck you out,
And, with your former energy recall'd,
Desire to go abroad, and see the light
Of day once more? You see it, and would fain
Be hidden from the sunshine that you sought.</p><p>PHAEDRA</p><p>Thou glorious author of a hapless race,
Whose daughter 'twas my mother's boast to be,
Who well may'st blush to see me in such plight,
For the last time I come to look on thee,
O Sun!</p><p>OENONE</p><p>What! Still are you in love with death?
Shall I ne'er see you, reconciled to life,
Forego these cruel accents of despair?</p><p>PHAEDRA</p></div> </div>
