<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>OENONE</p><p>Your wrath is just.
'Tis well that that ill-omen'd name can rouse
Such rage. Then live. Let love and duty urge
Their claims. Live, suffer not this son of Scythia,
Crushing your children 'neath his odious sway,
To rule the noble offspring of the gods,
The purest blood of Greece. Make no delay;
Each moment threatens death; quickly restore
Your shatter'd strength, while yet the torch of life
Holds out, and can be fann'd into a flame.</p><p>PHAEDRA</p><p>Too long have I endured its guilt and shame!</p><p>OENONE</p><p>Why? What remorse gnaws at your heart? What crime
Can have disturb'd you thus? Your hands are not
Polluted with the blood of innocence?</p><p>PHAEDRA</p><p>Thanks be to Heav'n, my hands are free from stain.
Would that my soul were innocent as they!</p></div> </div>
