Howe'er convinced she is your enemy,
Some shade of pity to her tears is due.</p><p>HIPPOLYTUS</p><p>Shall we part thus? and will you let me go,
Not knowing if my boldness has offended

My sceptre. All the gifts you offer me
Will I accept, but this high throne of empire
Is not the one most precious in my sight.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
