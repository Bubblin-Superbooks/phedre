Your peace no longer, and the soul of Theseus

Tell how he died?</p><p>ISMENE</p><p>Rumours incredible
Are spread. Some say that, seizing a new bride,
The faithless husband by the waves was swallow'd.
Others affirm, and this report prevails,
That with Pirithous to the world below
He went, and saw the shores of dark Cocytus,
Showing himself alive to the pale ghosts;
But that he could not leave those gloomy realms,
Which whoso enters there abides for ever.</p><p>ARICIA</p></div> </div>
