But 'tis my duty, Madam, to reveal them.
The hand of death has seized your peerless husband,
And you are last to hear of this disaster.</p><p>OENONE</p><p>What say you, Panope?</p><p>PANOPE</p><p>The queen, deceived
By a vain trust in Heav'n, begs safe return
For Theseus, while Hippolytus his son
Learns of his death from vessels that are now
In port.</p></div> </div>
