And I can stay no more in lovely Troezen.
In doubt that racks my soul with mortal anguish,
I grow ashamed of such long idleness.
Six months and more my father has been gone,
And what may have befallen one so dear
I know not, nor what corner of the earth
Hides him.</p><p>THERAMENES</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">And where, prince, will you look for him?
Already, to content your just alarm,
Have I not cross'd the seas</p></div> </div>
